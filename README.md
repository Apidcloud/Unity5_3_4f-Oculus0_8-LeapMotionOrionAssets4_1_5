# Unity5_3_4f-Oculus0_8-LeapMotionOrionAssets4_1_5
A simple test project with Unity 5.3.4f running Leap Motion Orion Assets 4.1.5 on top of Oculus runtime 0.8

This project was created with the intent of using the latest Leap Motion Orion Assets (4.1.5) together with Oculus runtime 0.8, which was last implemented in Unity 5.3.4f.
It fixes the compatibility issues with LeapServiceProvider (Assets\LeapMotion\Scripts\LeapServiceProvider.cs).
